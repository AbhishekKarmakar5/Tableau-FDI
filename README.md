Case Study: Foreign Direct Investment, FDI
In this case study we explore the FDI dataset and analyse it from the perspective of a business.
We shall look at various sectors to determine which sector will prove most beneficial to collaborate with, for the company.
Questions that we will be examining include:
1. Which sector received the maximum direct funding for a given year?
2. Which sector received the minimum direct funding for a given year?
3. Is there a trend for direct investments for individual sectors?
4. In what fashion can the sectors be grouped for comparison?
5. Which sectors reported the highest growth within the last five years?
6. Which sectors reported the highest decline within the last five years?
7. Which sectors reported the most variation overall?
8. What is the proportion of investment between sectors from the FDI perspective?
9. Are there any specific clusters present in the data?
10. Can we forecast the trend for the following year?
